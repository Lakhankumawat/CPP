# Sorting Algorithms

- Sorting basically refers to rearranging a collection of data into ascending or descending order.
- It is helpful when we have to perform searching faster, or to identify similar items.
- Some algorithms make use of sorting as a key subroutine.

### Terms explained :

- In place: If only constant memory is required other than the input array.
- Stable : If the order of identical elements in the array is retained.
- Make sure to understand the difference between increasing and non-decreasing order.



## Bubble Sort

- It repeatedly loops through the array elements to be sorted and compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are not in order.
-  A point to note : After every n^th iteration, the n^th largest element reaches at its right place (if sorting in ascending order)
-  We can find if an array is sorted or not using bubble sort in one iteration itself.

### Algorithm

```

begin BubbleSort(array)
    for all items in array
        if array[i]>array[i+1]
            swap(array[i],array[i+1])
        end if
    end for

    return array

end BubbleSort

```

### Properties

- Time Complexity : O(n^2)
- Auxillary Space : O(1)
- In-place : Yes
- Stable : Yes

### Advantages

- Can be useful to sort nearly-sorted arrays.

### Disadvantage

- Too slow and impractical in most cases.
