# Sorting Algorithms

- Sorting basically refers to rearranging a collection of data into ascending or descending order.
- It is helpful when we have to perform searching faster, or to identify similar items.
- Some algorithms make use of sorting as a key subroutine.

### Terms explained :

- In place: If only constant memory is required other than the input array.
- Stable : If the order of identical elements in the array is retained.
- Make sure to understand the difference between increasing and non-decreasing order.



## Bubble Sort

- It repeatedly loops through the array elements to be sorted and compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are not in order.
-  A point to note : After every n^th iteration, the n^th largest element reaches at its right place (if sorting in ascending order)
-  We can find if an array is sorted or not using bubble sort in one iteration itself.

### Algorithm

```

begin BubbleSort(array)
    for all items in array
        if array[i]>array[i+1]
            swap(array[i],array[i+1])
        end if
    end for

    return array

end BubbleSort

```

### Properties

- Time Complexity : O(n^2)
- Auxillary Space : O(1)
- In-place : Yes
- Stable : Yes

### Advantages

- Can be useful to sort nearly-sorted arrays.

### Disadvantage

- Too slow and impractical in most cases.

## DNF Sort
DNF Sort (Dutch National Flag Sorting) , This is the sorting method which is specially designed for only the array which contain numbers `0's` `1's` and `2's` only.

## Approach

**The Array is divided into four Sections**

1. `a[1 to low-1]` for zeroes and as repect to flag (red in Dutch Flag).
2. `a[low to mid-1]` for ones and as repect to flag (white).
3. `a[mid to high]` no change.
4. `a[high+1 to n(size)]` for twos and as respect to flag (blue).

## Algorithm

1. Initialize the `low = 0` , `mid = 0` and `high = size - 1`.
2. Traverse the array from starting to last till mid is less than equal to high.
3. If the element is 0 then swap the element with the element at index low and increase low and mid by 1.
4. If the element is 1 then increase mid by 1.
5. If the element is 2 then swap the element with the element at index high and decrease the high by 1.

## Time Complexity

_O(n)_ where **n** is the size of array.

## Space Complexity

_O(1)_ as there is **no extra space** is required.


## Counting Sort

- Counting sort is a special sorting algorithm that sorts the multiple elements without performing any comparison. It counts the number of occurences of the various elements .This counting can be stored in a temporary array in which elements are marked as indexes and count of their occurences stored as values of the array .

<!-- citation : [Here](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/counting-sort)  -->


### Algorithm

```

begin countSort(arr, n)
    declare a count array of max range 256.
    mark all elements of the count array as 0.

    Run a for loop from i:=0 to i:=n-1 :
      compute the count of every element present in the array and store it at ith position of the count array.
    
    Run a for loop from i=1 to 256 :
      Convert the count array to prefix sum array by cummulative addding of previous elements.

    declare an output array of size n for storing the sorted sequence.

    Run a for loop from j:=n-1 to 0 :
      Insert the elments in the output using the count and original array, and Decrease  the count of each element restored by 1.

    Finally run a loop from i:=0 to i:=n-1 :
      Copy the values of output array into the original array.

  [end of program]
```

### Properties

- Time Complexity :
  - Worst case time	: O(n)
  - Best case time : O(n)
  - Average case time : O(n)
- Auxillary Space : O(n)
- In-place : No
- Stable : Yes

### Advantages

- Linear time sorting technique, making it faster than comparison based algorithms.

### Disadvantage

- Works for restricted inputs only for a certain range and takes extra space.
