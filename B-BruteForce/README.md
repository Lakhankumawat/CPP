Calculating new price offered after discount to the customer .

Problem Statement :

A shopkeeper sells an object at some price p . To increase the sales of the object he decides to offer a discount of d% on the object . 
Calculate the new discounted price for which the customer buys the good .

Solution :

1. Calculate the d% of the original price p.

2. Subtract this d% of p from the original price p to get the new price p'.

3. p'= p - (d*p/100);

4. Print this new discounted price p' .


Time Complexity : The solution requires O(1) i.e. constant time complexity to calculate the discounted price . 

Space Complexity : The solution requires O(1) space .

The above problem is solved using Brute Force approach .
