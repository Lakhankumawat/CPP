Solution :

1. If the given weight of watermelon is odd , we cannot divide it into two boys such that each boy gets even weight of watermelon .

2. If the given weight of watermelon is an even enumber except 2 , we can divide it into two boys such that each boy gets even weight of watermelon .

3. If the given weight of watermelon is 2 , we cannot divide it into two boys such that each boy gets even weight of watermelon because for 2 , only one 
   division of weight is possible i.e. into pieces of weight 1 each which is an odd number .
   
 Time Complexity : The solution requires O(1) i.e. constant time complexity to calculate the weights of watermelon piece given to the two boys .

Space Complexity : The solution requires O(1) space .

The above problem is solved using Brute Force approach .
