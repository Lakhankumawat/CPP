<h1>The Karatsuba algorithm is a fast multiplication algorithm that uses a divide and conquer approach to multiply two numbers</h1>
 <p>the algorithm working in binary numbers so convert the number from decamal to binary then start the algorithm </p>
 <p>Time Complexity: O(n<sup>log<sub>2</sub><sup>3</sup></sup>)
