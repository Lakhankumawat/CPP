# Equal Sum Partition Problem
# Problem Statement 1

Given an array you have to output true or false depending on whether the array can be divided into two subsets such that the sum of both the subsets is equal. 

        > Note this question is a variation of 01 Knapsack problem

## Examples
```
Input: arr[] = {1, 5, 11, 5}
Output: true 
The array can be partitioned as {1, 5, 5} and {11}

Input: arr[] = {1, 5, 3}
Output: false 
The array cannot be partitioned into equal sum sets.

```
# Explanation

- Consider you are given an array.

- Let's say the array is divided into two subsets P1 and P2 and sum of P1 is S1 and P2 is S2.

- Now the questions says that sum of both the subsets must be same i.e S1=S2=S.

- This means the sum of the original array should be S+S=2S (Even as the number is 2*Sum).
This implies that we can get two such subsets when the sum of the original given array is Even.

    - In example arr[]= {1,5,11,5}
    Sum of array is 1+5+11+5=22 which is even. 

    - In example arr[]= {1,5,3}
    Sum of array is 1+5+3=9 which is odd and an odd number can never be divided into two equal parts.

     > Here you have to divide the number as int so you cannot divide the number as 11.5 and 11.5

- So in the question we can first calculate the sum of the array and ***if(sum%2!=0)*** (i.e sum=odd) we can return false

 ``` C++
    int sum=0;
    for(int i=0;i<size;i++)
        sum=sum+arr[i];

    if(sum%2!=0)
         return false;

 ```

- Now if the sum is even then 
we need to find one subset whose sum is S/2 because if we can find one subset with sum =S/2 then there will always be another subset with sum=S/2 as the sum of whole array is S.

So we call the subsetSum function.

``` C++
    input:arr[i]
      int sum=0;
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        sum+=arr[i];

    if(sum%2!=0)
         return false;

    else if (sum%2==0)
        return subsetSum(arr,sum/2,n);

```
- In subsetSum function the problem can be solved using dynamic programming when the sum of the elements is not too big. We can create a 2D array t[][] of size (n+1)*(sum/2 + 1). And we can construct the solution in a bottom-up manner such that every filled entry has the following property  
```
t[i][j] = true if a subset of {arr[0], arr[1], ..arr[j-1]} has sum equal to i, otherwise false

```

# Problem Statement 2:
```
You will be given two strings. 
You have to find the number of times the second string occurs in the first string, be it continuous or discontinuous.
Example 1::
Input : String A: abcde
String B: abc
Output: 1

Example 2::
Input : String A: abcaeb
String B: ab
Output: 3

```

# Explanations
The fundamental idea to solve this problem is to process all characters of both the strings one by one starting from from left to the right side
If last characters of both strings are same, either consider it or ignore the last character of the first string.
If last characters of both strings are different then ignore last character of the first string.
For this, we use dynamic programming meethod and fill up the dp matrix by bottom-up approach.
