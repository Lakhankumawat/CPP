## N-CANDY PROBLEM
we are given n candys and there are n persons and we have to distribute them among each person

we have a like array P1,P2,P3 and C1,C2,C3 to store who likes which candies

Find out the number of ways to distribute n candies among n persons
LIKE ARRAY

    C1 C2 C3
P1   1  1  1
P2   1  0  1
P3   1  1  1

This takes  O(N!)

Thus we need Bit Masking
