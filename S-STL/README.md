# Map in STL

* Maps are associative containers that store elements in a mapped fashion. Each element has a key value and a mapped value. No two mapped values can have the same key values.

## Some basic functions associated with Map: 
* begin() – Returns an iterator to the first element in the map.
* end() – Returns an iterator to the theoretical element that follows the last element in the map.
* size() – Returns the number of elements in the map.
* max_size() – Returns the maximum number of elements that the map can hold.
* empty() – Returns whether the map is empty.
* clear() – Removes all the elements from the map.
