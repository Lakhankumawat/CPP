#include<deque>
```

# Basic Syntax
```cpp
// dequeue<int> deque_name;

deque<int> deque_one;
```

# Oerations :
```cpp
deque_one.push_front()
```

```cpp
deque_one.push_back()
```

```cpp
deque_one.pop_front()
```

```cpp
deque_one.pop_back()
```

```cpp
deque_one.at()
```

```cpp
deque_one.begin()
```

```cpp
deque_one.end()
```

```cpp
deque_one.emplace_front()
```

```cpp
deque_one.emplace_back()
```

```cpp
deque_one.size()
```

```cpp
deque_one.empty()
```
