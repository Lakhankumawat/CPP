# Stack in STL

* ### Stack is an Adaptive Container which means that it provides a different manner to implement sequential characters

* ### It is based on the LIFO (Last In First Out) Structure

* ### Recrusion too works on the principal  of Stack

# Libraray needed to be include
```cpp
#include<stack>
```

# Basic syntax


```cpp
// stack<data_type> stack_name;

stack<int> stack_one;
```

# Opearations :

+ ### ```stack_one.push()```
+ ### ```stack_one.pop()```
+ ### ```stack_one.top()```
+ ### ```stack_one.size()```
+ ### ```stack_one.empty()```
+ ### ```stack_one.swap()```
+ ### ```stack_one.emplace```

> All these are operations are discussed in "stack_operations.cpp" file.
