# [Inversion Count](https://github.com/Lakhankumawat/LearnCPP/blob/main/Day-100(Algorithms)/R-Recursion/Inversion_Count.cpp) 

Inversion Count for an array indicates – how far (or close) the array is from being sorted. If the array is already sorted, then the inversion count is 0, 
but if the array is sorted in the reverse order, the inversion count is the maximum. <br><br>
Formally speaking, two elements a[i] and a[j] form an inversion if a[i] > a[j] and i < j <br>
## Example
```
Input: arr[] = {8, 4, 2, 1}
Output: 6

Explanation: Given array has six inversions:
(8, 4), (4, 2), (8, 2), (8, 1), (4, 1), (2, 1).


Input: arr[] = {3, 1, 2}
Output: 2

Explanation: Given array has two inversions:
(3, 1), (3, 2) 
```
# [Replace PI](https://github.com/Lakhankumawat/LearnCPP/blob/main/Day-100(Algorithms)/R-Recursion/Replace_%CF%80.cpp)

Recursive program to replace all occurrences of pi with 3.14 in a given string
## Examples: 
```
Input : str = “pippppiiiipi” 
Output : 3.14ppp3.14iii3.14

Input : str = “pip” 
Output : 3.14p

Input : str = “xpix” 
Output : x3.14x
```


# Adding subsequence with K sum problem
Given an array arr[] of length N and a number K, the task is to find all the subsequences of the array whose sum of elements is K

```
Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 3}, K = 3 
Output: 
1 2 
3

Input: arr[] = {17, 18, 6, 11, 2, 4}, K = 6  
Output: 
2 4 
6
```
