# [Inversion Count](https://github.com/Lakhankumawat/LearnCPP/blob/main/Day-100(Algorithms)/R-Recursion/Inversion_Count.cpp) 

Inversion Count for an array indicates – how far (or close) the array is from being sorted. If the array is already sorted, then the inversion count is 0, 
but if the array is sorted in the reverse order, the inversion count is the maximum. <br><br>
Formally speaking, two elements a[i] and a[j] form an inversion if a[i] > a[j] and i < j <br>
## Example
```
Input: arr[] = {8, 4, 2, 1}
Output: 6

Explanation: Given array has six inversions:
(8, 4), (4, 2), (8, 2), (8, 1), (4, 1), (2, 1).


Input: arr[] = {3, 1, 2}
Output: 2

Explanation: Given array has two inversions:
(3, 1), (3, 2)

# [Replace PI](https://github.com/Lakhankumawat/LearnCPP/blob/main/Day-100(Algorithms)/R-Recursion/Replace_%CF%80.cpp)

Recursive program to replace all occurrences of pi with 3.14 in a given string
## Examples: 
```
Input : str = “pippppiiiipi” 
Output : 3.14ppp3.14iii3.14

Input : str = “pip” 
Output : 3.14p

Input : str = “xpix” 
Output : x3.14x

# [Tower of Hanoi](https://github.com/bhumikatewary/LearnCPP/blob/ddd6b1e51cecd18d72f76f303cefe7f341f3092f/R-Recursion/TowerofHanoi.cpp)

Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical game or puzzle involving three sticks and a number of different discs, <br>
which can slip on any stick/rod. The paradox begins with discs embedded in the same object in a declining size(descending order), <br>
the smallest at the top, thus almost showing a conical shape.

Here are three simple rules:
1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. Each movement involves taking a disk above one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack. <br>
 In other words, the disk can only be moved if it is the highest disk in the stack.
3. No larger disk can be placed on a smaller disk.

## Example
```
Input : 2
Output : Disk 1 moved from X to Y
         Disk 2 moved from X to Z
         Disk 1 moved from Y to Z
         
Explanation:          
Taking the example for 2 disks :
Let rod 1 = 'X', rod 2 = 'Y', rod 3 = 'Z'.

Step 1 : Shift first disk from 'X' to 'Y'.
Step 2 : Shift second disk from 'X' to 'Z'.
Step 3 : Shift first disk from 'Y' to 'Z'.

The pattern here is :
Shift 'n-1' disks from 'X' to 'Y'.
Shift last disk (nth) from 'X' to 'Y'.
Shift 'n-1' disks from 'Y' to 'Z'.
```

### Algorithm

```
START
Procedure Hanoi(disk, source, destination, auxillary)

   IF disk == 1, THEN
      move disk from source to destination             
   ELSE
      Hanoi(disk - 1, source, auxillary, destination)     // Step 1
      move disk from source to destination                // Step 2
      Hanoi(disk - 1, auxillary, destination, source)     // Step 3
   END IF
   
END Procedure
STOP
```

### Properties

- Time Complexity : O(n)
- Space Complexity : O(n)

### Advantages

- The Tower of Hanoi puzzle is sensitive to previous damage and malfunction. The level of complexity can be easily
 increased or decreased with additional discs.

### Disadvantage

- The Hanoi Tower cannot be used independently to understand and evaluate higher brain functions.


# [Maze Path](https:github.com/prachi0011/LearnCPP/maze_path.cpp)
Take as input N1 and N2, both numbers. N1 and N2 is the number of rows and columns on a rectangular board. Our player starts in top-left corner of the board and must reach bottom-right corner. In one move the player can move 1 step horizontally (right) or 1 step vertically (down).
Function will do 2 things:
- a. returns the count of different ways the player can travel across the board. 
- b. returns an ArrayList of moves for all valid paths across the board. 
### Example
```
 Input :  m = 2, n = 2;
Output : 2, VH HV
There are two paths
(0, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (1, 1)
(0, 0) -> (1, 0) -> (1, 1)

Input :  m = 2, n = 3;
Output : 3, HHV HVV VHH
There are three paths
(0, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (0, 2) -> (1, 2)
(0, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (1, 1) -> (1, 2)
(0, 0) -> (1, 0) -> (1, 1) -> (1, 2)
```

```
START
Intialize n1, n2
Procedure maze(i, j, s)
IF i == n1-1 && j == n2-1
		cout<<s<<" ";
		a += 1;
		return;
END IF

IF i < n1-1
		maze(i+1,j,s+"V");
END IF
IF j < n2-1
		maze(i,j+1,s+"H");
END IF
END Procedure
END
```

### Properties
- Time Complexity: O(2^(m*n)), because on every cell we need to try 2 different directions.
- Space Complexity:  O(m*n) ,Maximum Depth of the recursion tree(auxiliary space).
