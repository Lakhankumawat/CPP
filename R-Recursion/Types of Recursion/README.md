# Recursion


- The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called a recursive function. 
- Using recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite easily.
- Examples of such problems are Towers of Hanoi (TOH), Inorder/Preorder/Postorder Tree Traversals, DFS of Graph, etc.

## Tree Recursion

- There are some problems for which we haven't explicitly described a recursive pattern for yet. Consider the following problem:
- I want to go up a flight of stairs that has n steps. I can either take 1 or 2 steps each time. How many different ways can I go up this flight of stairs?

- For example, in the case where n is 5, there are 8 possible ways:

```
1 1 1 1 1
2 1 1 1
1 2 1 1
1 1 2 1
1 1 1 2
1 2 2
2 1 2
2 2 1
```

- In order to solve this problem, we have to introduce a pattern called Tree Recursion. Tree Recursion is just a phrase to describe when you make a recursive call more than once in your recursive case. Why would we need to do this here? Consider one solution to the above problem:

- we call the function fib(4) which generates two more calls fib(3) and fib(2).
- fib(2) makes a call for fib(1). 
- BASE CASE: fib(0) which falls under our base case the sum of their returned value (1) is returned to parent fib(2). 
- Similarly, for fib(3) it makes a call for fib(2) and fib(1).
- fib(1) falls under base case fib(2) follows the same procedure the sum (2) is returned to fib(3). 
- At last, the sum of fib(2) and fib(3) is returned to the main parent call fib(4) giving 3 as our output.
 
### Time Complexity
```
- For Tree Recursion: O(2^n) 
```

### Space Complexity 
```
For Tree Recursion: O(n)
```

### Advantages

- Some problems are more easily solved by thinking tree recursively. Try writing count-change using for loops in another language.
- Some problems are intractably hard, meaning the fastest known algorithms we have for them are still exponential in runtime.
- Turns out we can optimize tree recursive procedures without changing their shape

### Disadvantages

- As recursion uses stack, for large numbers, memory may become full due to stack full



# Indirect Recursion

 In this recursion, there may be more than one functions and they are calling one another in a circular manner.

int num()
{
	...
	...
	int sum();

}

int sum()
{
	...
	...
	int num();

}


* For indirect recursion, both the functions need to be declared before they are defined.

## Algorithm

* user input the value and that value will be given to fun(A) as input .
* Then under the fun(A) , fun(A) will call fun(B) with some modification.
* Then fun(B) will call fun(C) with some other modification.
* Then fun(C) again call fun(A) with some other modifications.

From the above diagram fun(A) is calling for fun(B), fun(B) is calling for fun(C) and fun(C) is calling for fun(A) and thus it makes a cycle.

Letâ€™s understand the example by tracing tree of recursive function. That is how the calls are made and how the outputs are produced.

## Properties
* Time complexity of indirect recursion is O(2^n).
* Space complexity of indirect recursion is O(nm).

## Advantages
* For a recursive function, you only need to define the base case and recursive case, so the code is simpler and shorter than an iterative code.
* Some problems are inherently recursive, such as Graph and Tree Traversal.


## Disadvantages
* A recursive program has greater space requirements than an iterative program as each function call will remain in the stack until the base case is reached.
* It also has greater time requirements because each time the function is called, the stack grows and the final answer is returned when the stack is popped completely.
