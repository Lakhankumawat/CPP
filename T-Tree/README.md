## Binary Tree
A Hierarchical data structure that stores data in the form of a tree and can have either **0,1 or 2 children** at each node.
It works on the rule that a node which has lesser value that the root is placed on the left subtree and the one with more value 
than the root is kept on the right subtree.

## Components of the Tree:
- Pointer to left subtree.
- Data element.
- Pointer to right subtree.

## Lowest Common Ancestor(LCA)
The Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) of two nodes in a rooted tree is the lowest (deepest) node that 
is an ancestor of both the nodes.

**Finding the LCA** - The idea is to traverse the tree starting from the root. If any of the given keys (n1 and n2) matches with the root, then the root is LCA (assuming that both keys are present). If the root doesnâ€™t match with any of the keys, we recur for the left and right subtree. The node which has one key present in its left subtree and the other key present in the right subtree is the LCA. If both keys lie in the left subtree, then the left subtree has LCA also, otherwise, LCA lies in the right subtree.

## Benefits of a Binary Tree
- The search operation in a binary tree is faster as compared to other trees.
- Converting postfix and prefix expressions are possible using binary trees.
- Graph traversal also uses binary trees.
- Easier to find the maximum and minimum elements.
