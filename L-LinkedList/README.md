# LINKED LIST
A linked list is a sequence of nodes which are connected via a link.

It works same as the <b>principle of blockchain</b> but instead of storing the address/hash of previous block,
it either stores the address of the next block and previous block or only the address of the next block.
And the last block points to a NULL address.<br><br>

In linked list, these blocks are known as _nodes_.

>What is Node?

>Node is a block of element which stores some data and the address.

**NOTE : Nodes may take continuous memory location but not necessary to have.**

>First node is known as **Head** and the last node known as **Tail** of the linked list.
