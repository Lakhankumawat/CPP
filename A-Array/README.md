# [REVERSE1]
 ## ALGORITHM

1.Take input the size of the array and the elements of the array.
 2.Consider a function reverse1 which takes the parameters-the array(say arr) and the size of the array(say n).
 3.Inside the function, a new array (with the array size of the first array, arr) is initialized. The array arr[] is iterated from the first element, and each element of array arr[] is placed in the new array from the back, i.e., the new array is iterated from its last element.
 4.In this way, all the elements of the array arr[] are placed reversely in the new array.
 5.Further, we can iterate through the new array from the beginning and print the elements of the array.

 ## PROPERTIES
 Time-complexity-->O(n)
 Space-complexity-->O(n)

 ## EXAMPLES
1->Input : 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
 Output :5, 4, 3, 2, 1

2->Input :  10, 20, 30, 40
 Output : 40, 30, 20, 10



 # [Reverse2]

 ## ALGORITHM
 The reverse2 method uses a similar code for the inputting and printing of the array. However, we don’t create a new array like the above method. Instead, we reverse the original array itself. In this method, we swap the elements of the array. The first element is swapped with the last element. The second element is swapped with the last but one element and so on. 
 For instance, consider array [1, 2, 3, …., n-2, n-1, n]. We swap 1 with n, 2 with n-1, 3 with n-2 and further.

## Example:

## Differnt Approches:
We would be solving the problem by following approaches –
1. Brute force approach
2. Cumulative sum approach
3. Efficient Approach: Kadane’s Algorithm

## 1. Brute force Approach (simple)
The simple approach to solve this problem is to run three for loops and For each subarray arr[i..j], calculate its sum. Update maxSum if last calculated sum is smaller than the current sum. 
  #### Algorithm:
  ```
  int maxSubarraySum1 ( int a [] , int n) 
  { 
    int maxSum = INT_MIN
    for(i = 0 to n-1) 
    { 
      for(j = i to n-1) 
      { 
        int sum = 0 
        for(k = i to j) 
          sum = sum + a[k] 
        Update maxSum if its smaller than sum with the maxSum value 
      } 
    } 
return maxSum
}

```

**Time Complexity:** `O(n^3)`, Where n is the size of the array. \
**Space Complexity:** `O(1)`

## 2. Cumulative Sum Approach:
For each subarray arr[i..j], calculate its sum. Using prefix sum can
reduce time to calculate the sum of arr[i..j] to O(1) 
#### Algorithm:
```
int maxSubarraySum2 ( int a [] , int n) 
{ 
  int currsum[n+1]
  Currsum[0] = 0
  int maxSum = INT_MIN
  for(i = 1 to n-1) 
  { 
	  cumsum[i] = cumsum[i - 1] + a[i];
  }
  for(i = 1 to n-1) 
  { 
    int sum = 0 
    for(j = 0 to i) 
      sum = currsum[i - currsum[j] 
      Update maxSum if its smaller than sum with the maxSum value 
  } 
return maxSum
} 

```
**Time Complexity:** `O(n^2)`, Where n is the size of the array.\
**Space Complexity:** `O(n)`

## 3. Efficient Approach: Kadane’s Algorithm
Kadane’s Algorithm is an iterative dynamic programming algorithm. It calculates the maximum sum subarray ending at a particular position by using the maximum sum subarray ending at the previous position. Basic logic is to start taking the sum of the array, as soon as it gets negative, discard the current subarray, and start a new sum. 
  #### Algorithm:
  ```
  Initialize:
    currsum = 0
    maxSum = INT_MIN
    
Loop for each element of the array
  (a) currsum = currsum + a[i]
  (b) if(currsum  < 0)
            currsum = 0
	  Othewise maxSum = currsum
return max_so_far

```
**Time complexity:** `O(n)`, Where n is the size of the array. \
**Space complexity:** `O(1)`

  - [Properties_of_trace_matrix](#properties-of-trace-matrix)
  - [Example](#example)
  - [Algorithim](#algorithm)
  - [Time complexity](#time-complexity)

## Trace:

The trace of a matrix A, defined by tr(A), is the sum of the diagonal elements of a matrix. Trace of a matrix is only possible for square matrix.

## Normal:

The normal of matrix is the sum of all the elements of a matrix and then the square root of sum.

## Properties of trace matrix:
```
 --> tr(A + B) = tr(A) +tr(B)
 --> tr(cA) = ctr(A)  ** c represents scalars
 --> tr(A) = tr(A^T)  ** T means transpose of matrix 
```
## Example:

### Trace:

we have taken following as the elements of a matrix 
2 3 5
7 4 5
8 5 4

we have to add all the elements of the matrix and store it in sum variable,sum = 2+3+5+7+4+5+8+5+4 then we will find the square root of sum we get 6.55
so, normal of matrix = 6.55

### Normal:

Now we will first check the conditions for trace of matrix (i.e. row==column) then we will add all the diagonal elements 
trace = 2+4+4  so, trace of matrix = 10

## Algorithm:
```
1. Enter the order of a matrix (eg: 3X3 or 2X2 etc...)
2. Using loop enter the elements of a matrix .
3. Printing the elements of the matrix .
4. Finding the sum of all the elements of the matrix .
5. Then the square root of the sum using sqrt() to find the normal of the matrix and store it in variable normal.
6. Using the condition row == column we can find the sum of diagonal elements of a matrix , value of sum will be store in
 variable trace .
7. Print the value of normal and trace of a matrix .
```
## Time complexity:
```
Time complexity of trace of a matrix is n^2.
Time complexity of normal of a matrix is n^2.

# Prefix Sum

Given an array of N integers. Given Q queries and in each query given L and R print sum of array elements from index L to R (both inclusive)

### Naive Approach
Use a loop to calculate the sum of numbers from l to r for each query.

Time Complexity: `O(N) + O(Q*N) = 10^ 10`   
Space Complexity: `O(1)`

### Optimial Approach


Use prefix sum , a pre-computation technique , to calculate the sum .

We declare a prefix[] array which stores the sum of numbers from 1 to ith index.
prefix[i] --->  Stores the sum of numbers from 1 to ith index

So, to calculate the sum of numbers from l to r , we deduce a formula:

prefix[r] ----> Stores sum of numbers from 1 to rth index
prefix[l-1] ----> Stores sum of numbers from 1 to (l-1)th index

So, to output the sum of numbers from l to r , we use this:   
prefix[r]-prefix[l-1]        (O(1) time complexity)

 Time Complexity:  `O(N) + O(N) + O(Q) =  10^5 `
 Space Complexity: `O(N)  + O(N) (Using prefix array)`

## Approach Used -> Sliding Window Approach:
For every k size window store every element if negative in deque from rear end using for loop then check size of deque size if greater than 0 then then get the element from front and store it in vector. If deque size is 0 store 0 in vector. Move the window ahead if we have reached or passed the last element of the window.
 #### Algorithm:
  ```
    1. Initialize deque and vector.
    2. Use loop for starting window that is till k.
    3. Push back the index in deque if element is negative.
    4. Push back 0 if element is positive.
    5. Check the size of deque after execution of loop if size > 0 get the front element of deque(index) store the element at that index in vector.
    6. Else store 0 in vector.
    7. Use loop from k till last index of array.
    8. Check if deque is not empty  && loop variable - front element of deque is not greater than or equal to k.
    9. If step 8 is true pop the front element in deque.
    10.Repeat  steps 5,6 and 8, 9  till execution of loop

  ```

## Time and space complexity: 
```
 Time Complexity =  O(n-k), Where n is the size of the array and k is window size.
 Space complexity = O(n-k+1), size of vector returned. 

```
