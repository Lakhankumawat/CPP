# String Comparison:
Most string comparison algorithms compare the strings character by character. C++ provides us some built in operators like == and != to compare strings along with strcmp and compare functions.

# Example:

## Example1:
Suppose there are two strings :
string1: HELLO WORLD
string2: HELLO
in these two strings 1st string contains "HELLO WORLD" but the 2nd string does not contain the word "WORLD" so,these two string are not equal.

## Example2:
Suppose there are two strings :
string1: HELLO WORLD
string2: HELLO WORLD
Here both the strings contain the same word "HELLO WORLD" hence both the strings are same.  

# Application :
For example, consider a website having two fields ‘Email’ & ‘Confirm Email’. It would have to use some sort of string comparison in order to confirm whether both the entered email strings are equal or not.

# Algorithim :
1. Decelare two strings.
2. take the input of two strings.
3. comparing the two strings we can use any of the three methords mentioned below.

# Ways to compare strings :
1. strcmp() inbuilt function
2. compare() inbuilt function, and
3. C++ relational operators ( ‘==’, ‘!=’)
