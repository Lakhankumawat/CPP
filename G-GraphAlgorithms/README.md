## Multistage Graph

- Multistage graph is a directed graph in which vertices can be divided in sets ( stages) such that vertices on same stage do not have edges between them and can't have a edge from present stage to previous stage .
-  Given a source and destination for which shortest path is to be find.

### Algorithm

```

shortestPath(graph)
{
    cost[n] =0;
    for (i : n-2 to 1) do
    { cost[n-1] = INT_MAX
        for(j : 1 to n ) do
        {
            if (graph[i][j] = INT_MAX) then continue
            cost[i] = min(cost[i],graph[i][j]+cost[j]);
        }
    }

    return cost[0]
}

```

### Properties

- Time Complexity : O(n^2) ,where n is number of vertices
- Auxiliary Space : O(n^2) ,where n is number of vertices

### Advantages

- More efficient as overlapping of sub problem stored and use. 

### Disadvantage

- Take more space as have to store the repeated overlapped subproblem.
